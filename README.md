# Semantic-parsing-logic

This is the project of the course of CS 181 and CS 131, artificial intelligence and compilers, respectively. 

Our goal is to translate natural language (English) into formal language (First-order logic) . 

Major methodology is manually defined semantic laws, possibly with some help of reinforcement learning and Markov logic. 

## Structure of the project directory: 
	- FLO-parsing is to implement semantic parsing using Rust (just a try, no guarantee to finish) 
	- FLO-generate is to implement translation from natural language to first-order logic using python. We can run "./demo.sh" to see the result in PDF
