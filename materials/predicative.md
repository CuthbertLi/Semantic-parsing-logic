# Carlson classes

The seminal work of Greg Carlson distinguishes between types of predicates.[15] Based on Carlson's work, predicates have been divided into the following sub-classes, which roughly pertain to how a predicate relates to its subject.

## Stage-level predicates

A stage-level predicate is true of a temporal stage of its subject. For example, if John is "hungry", then he typically will eat some food. His state of being hungry therefore lasts a certain amount of time, and not his entire lifespan. Stage-level predicates can occur in a wide range of grammatical constructions and are probably the most versatile kind of predicate.

## Individual-level predicates

An individual-level predicate is true throughout the existence of an individual. For example, if John is "smart", this is a property that he has, regardless of which particular point in time we consider. Individual-level predicates are more restricted than stage-level ones. Individual-level predicates cannot occur in presentational "there" sentences (a star in front of a sentence indicates that it is odd or ill-formed):

        There are police available. - available is stage-level predicate
        *There are firemen altruistic. - altruistic is an individual-level predicate

Stage-level predicates allow modification by manner adverbs and other adverbial modifiers. Individual-level predicates do not, e.g.

        Tyrone spoke French loudly in the corridor. - speak French can be interpreted as a stage-level predicate
        *Tyrone knew French silently in the corridor. - know French cannot be interpreted as a stage-level predicate

When an individual-level predicate occurs in past tense, it gives rise to what is called a lifetime effect: The subject must be assumed to be dead or otherwise out of existence.

        John was available. - Stage-level predicate does NOT evoke the lifetime effect.
        John was altruistic. - Individual-level predicate does evoke the lifetime effect.

## Kind-level predicates

A kind-level predicate is true of a kind of thing, but cannot be applied to individual members of the kind. An example of this is the predicate are widespread. One cannot meaningfully say of a particular individual John that he is widespread. One may only say this of kinds, as in

        Cats are widespread.

Certain types of noun phrases cannot be the subject of a kind-level predicate. We have just seen that a proper name cannot be. Singular indefinite noun phrases are also banned from this environment:

        *A cat is widespread. - Compare: Nightmares are widespread.

Collective vs. distributive predicates

Predicates may also be collective or distributive. Collective predicates require their subjects to be somehow plural, while distributive ones do not. An example of a collective predicate is "formed a line". This predicate can only stand in a nexus with a plural subject:

        The students formed a line. - Collective predicate appears with plural subject.
        *The student formed a line. - Collective predicate cannot appear with singular subject.

Other examples of collective predicates include meet in the woods, surround the house, gather in the hallway and carry the piano together. Note that the last one (carry the piano together) can be made non-collective by removing the word together. Quantifiers differ with respect to whether or not they can be the subject of a collective predicate. For example, quantifiers formed with all the can, while ones formed with every or each cannot.

        All the students formed a line. - Collective predicate possible with all the.
        All the students gathered in the hallway. - Collective predicate possible with all the.
        All the students carried a piano together. - Collective predicate possible with all the.
        *Every student formed a line. - Collective predicate impossible with every.
        *Each student gathered in the hallway. - Collective predicate impossible with each.
