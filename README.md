# Semantic-parsing-logic

This is the project of the course of CS 181 and CS 131, artificial intelligence and compilers, respectively. 

Our goal is to translate natural language into formal language. 

Major methodology is manually defined semantic laws, possibly with some help of reinforcement learning and Markov logic.
