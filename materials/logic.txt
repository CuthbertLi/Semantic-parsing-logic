Terms

The set of terms is inductively defined by the following rules:

    Variables. Any variable is a term.
    Functions. Any expression f(t1,...,tn) of n arguments (where each argument ti is a term and f is a function symbol of valence n) is a term. In particular, symbols denoting individual constants are nullary function symbols, and are thus terms.

Only expressions which can be obtained by finitely many applications of rules 1 and 2 are terms. For example, no expression involving a predicate symbol is a term.
Formulas

The set of formulas (also called well-formed formulas[9] or WFFs) is inductively defined by the following rules:

    Predicate symbols. If P is an n-ary predicate symbol and t1, ..., tn are terms then P(t1,...,tn) is a formula.
    Equality. If the equality symbol is considered part of logic, and t1 and t2 are terms, then t1 = t2 is a formula.
    Negation. If φ is a formula, then ¬ {\displaystyle \lnot } \lnot φ is a formula.
    Binary connectives. If φ and ψ are formulas, then (φ → {\displaystyle \rightarrow } \rightarrow ψ) is a formula. Similar rules apply to other binary logical connectives.
    Quantifiers. If φ {\displaystyle \varphi } \varphi is a formula and x is a variable, then ∀ x φ {\displaystyle \forall x\varphi } \forall x\varphi (for all x, φ {\displaystyle \varphi } \varphi holds) and ∃ x φ {\displaystyle \exists x\varphi } \exists x\varphi (there exists x such that φ {\displaystyle \varphi } \varphi ) are formulas.
